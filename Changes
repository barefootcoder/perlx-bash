    [New Features]
    * `bash -c` now works like the POD says it did all along.
    * Likewise, autoquoting now works like the POD says it did all along.
    * Also, `shq` now exists and is exported.

    [Bug Fixes]
    * `&` now properly considered to be a special character.
    * `head` and `tail` no longer go out-of-bounds of their input lists.
    * `bash \string =>` now autochomps, as expected.
    * Lines sent to filter mode subs are now pre-chomped, as expected.

    [Doc Fixes]
    * Added POD for all functions.
      (thx Pod::Coverage tests)
    * Added POD for filter modes.
    * Update: no longer considered experimental!

    [Distro Fixes]
    * Make `-x` testing work when Lmod is present.
      github #3 (thx Slaven ReziÄ‡ (SREZIC))
    * Fix CPAN Testers failure (in unit tests) for older versions of Perl.
    * Checking of minimum bash version was backwards.
    * Add diagnostic info for what version of bash we're dealing with.

    [New Features]
    * Can now "pipe" `bash` output through a Perl sub.
    * Passed in qr// args are quoted just like filenames.

    [Bug Fixes]
    * Combining capture and `-e` now works as expected.
    * Now get useful error message if you don't pass `bash` any args.
    * Ditto if you pass `bash` only capture and/or switch args.
    * Ditto if you pass `bash` any args which are not defined.
      (And no extra warning if it's the _first_ arg which is undef.)

    [Doc Fixes]
    * Now there is some.

    [Distro Fixes]
    * Fix CPAN Testers failure for older versions of List::Util.

    [Distro Fixes]
    * Force locale to 'C' when unit testing error messages.
      github #2 (thx Andreas Koenig (ANDK))
    * Skip most unit tests when there's no `bash` present.
      (This should solve CPAN Testers failures on MSWin systems.)
